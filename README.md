# GrowCV

**An AI-powered career coach that turns your daily work moments into a powerful, ever-growing bank of professional achievements — and generates perfectly tailored résumés on demand.**

## The Problem
Most people only update their résumé when they're actively job hunting.  
By that time, they've forgotten or downplayed half of their real impact.  
Writing strong, quantified bullet points from memory feels painful and overwhelming.

## The Solution
GrowCV is a proactive AI companion that:
- Asks you one short, smart question each day (or week) about your work — takes 1–3 minutes
- Intelligently summarizes and refines your answers into professional, action-oriented achievements
- Builds a private, tagged "achievement bank" over time
- When you're ready to apply: paste a job description → get a fully tailored, ATS-friendly résumé in seconds

No more scrambling. No more blank-page panic. Your career story grows naturally, every day.

## Core Features (2026 MVP)
- Daily/weekly smart check-in questions (rotated by category: impact, leadership, technical skills, collaboration, learning)
- AI-powered refinement of raw answers into strong résumé bullet points
- Private achievement bank with automatic tagging
- On-demand résumé generation: input job description → tailored output (PDF/DOCX)
- Simple, habit-forming web interface with streak tracking

## Tech Stack (planned)
- Python backend
- LLM integration (Grok API / OpenAI / Claude)
- Storage: SQLite → Supabase (with user auth)
- Frontend: Streamlit (MVP) → possibly React later
- Optional: Telegram/Slack bot or email reminders for daily entries

## 2026 Roadmap
